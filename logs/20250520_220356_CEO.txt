Query: Can you create a JIRA ticket?
Role: CEO

Context:
Sometimes we sort of mystify these agents as things that somehow require a lot of effort
to build, but it’s really pretty straight forward. In fact, our vision is that it should be as
simple as creating a Word doc or a PowerPoint slide or an Excel spreadsheet, that’s it.

When you say “agent,” think creating a doc.
This example is a good one, right? I can create field service sources, in this case, a
SharePoint site in my Dynamics CRM. I can easily configure it to meet my specific
needs, and you have an agent in seconds that’s just now integrated into Copilot.

You can also make these agents autonomous using Copilot Studio, and they can always
raise an exception in Copilot for input. Remember, even an autonomous agent from time

passively use them. The really brilliant thing that you all have done is taken the exact same set of
things and decided to make it available to any developer, who’s able to sign up for an API key.
SAM ALTMAN: Yeah, we try to be really thoughtful about what makes a good API for this.
