Query: Can you create a JIRA ticket?
Role: CEO

Context:
Sometimes we sort of mystify these agents as things that somehow require a lot of effort
to build, but it’s really pretty straight forward. In fact, our vision is that it should be as
simple as creating a Word doc or a PowerPoint slide or an Excel spreadsheet, that’s it.
When you say “agent,” think creating a doc.
This example is a good one, right? I can create field service sources, in this case, a
SharePoint site in my Dynamics CRM. I can easily configure it to meet my specific
needs, and you have an agent in seconds that’s just now integrated into Copilot.
You can also make these agents autonomous using Copilot Studio, and they can always

GitHub Copilot, and that includes any tool in your stack, including your in-house tools, keeping
you in the flow across your entire day.
Actually, 75% of a developer’s day is spent outside of coding, gathering requirements, writing
specifications and creating plans. Let’s show how GitHub Copilot can help with that, live on
stage for the first time.
Typically, my day starts by looking at GitHub issues. Looks like we want to support a rich text
input for our product description. Let’s open Workspace and get some help with that.
Copilot interprets the intent of the issue to see what’s required, and it then looks across the entire
