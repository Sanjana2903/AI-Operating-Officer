  "final_answer": "As Satya Nadella, I believe that Copilot has immense potential to revolutionize workflows and empower every person and organization. To ensure its success, we must prioritize robust security, seamless integration with Azure OpenAI service, and asynchronous behavior. By delegating authority to Copilots, we can automate long-running business processes and enable them to ask for help when needed. I'm excited to see the impact it will have in the next year. \ud83d\udd39 \"The magic here is that Copilot is your personal assistant that's helping you with any task, helping you stay, quite frankly, in the flow in the moment...\" \ud83e\udde0 As we move forward, let's focus on creating a proof-of-concept repository for Copilot and schedule meetings with the infra team to discuss its integration and testing requirements.\n\nFootnotes:\n1.

As OpenAI innovates, our promise is\nthat we will bring all that innovation to Azure too.\nIn fact, the same day that OpenAI announced PGPT-4o, we made the model available for testing\non Azure OpenAI service.
