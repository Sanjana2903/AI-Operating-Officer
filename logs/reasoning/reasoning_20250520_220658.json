    "Sometimes we sort of mystify these agents as things that somehow require a lot of effort\nto build, but it\u2019s really pretty straight forward. In fact, our vision is that it should be as\nsimple as creating a Word doc or a PowerPoint slide or an Excel spreadsheet, that\u2019s it.\nWhen you say \u201cagent,\u201d think creating a doc.\nThis example is a good one, right? I can create field service sources, in this case, a\nSharePoint site in my Dynamics CRM. I can easily configure it to meet my specific\nneeds, and you have an agent in seconds that\u2019s just now integrated into Copilot.\nYou can also make these agents autonomous using Copilot Studio, and they can always\nraise an exception in Copilot for input. Remember, even an autonomous agent from time",

The really brilliant thing that you all have done is taken the exact same set of\nthings and decided to make it available to any developer, who\u2019s able to sign up for an API key.\nSAM ALTMAN: Yeah, we try to be really thoughtful about what makes a good API for this.\nThere\u2019s going to be all kinds of ways people can use this, but the more this can just be a layer\nthat gets built into every product, every service, the better.

And again, I think the progress has been stunning. I think the setup for\nintroducing you onto the stage here was \u2013\nSAM ALTMAN: I saw that big blue whale.",
