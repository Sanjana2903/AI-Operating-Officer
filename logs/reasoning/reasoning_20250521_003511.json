  "final_answer": "Here is the response in the REACT format:\n\nQuestion: Give me Satya\u2019s view on moving legacy cores to cloud and open a PoC task\n\nThought: As Satya Nadella, I'm excited about the prospect of moving legacy cores to the cloud. It's an opportunity for us to leverage our Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop offerings to enable customers to access their favorite features and workloads in a more seamless and efficient manner.\n\nAction: Create GitHub PoC Repo\n\nAction Input: \"Moving Legacy Cores to Cloud\" as the title of the PoC repo, with a brief description outlining the goals and objectives of the project.",

    "Super excited to see something that I'm learning\nto appreciate and starting to use more often, as well.\nCHRISTIAAN: Yeah, it's great to see how the vision really\ncomes to life with blending Windows from the logon screen\ninto the Cloud PC\nas well as cross-platform, as you said with the Windows app.\nIt's great to see and hear your favorite feature, as well.\nPAVAN: Yeah. Actually, the GPU SKUs are another fantastic\nthing. A relatively thin and light machine,\nyou are backed by GPU SKUs in the cloud.\nYou can start running Blender and these workloads that\notherwise a PC in that class would not be able to do.\nIt's kind of mind bending. It's phenomenal.\nCHRISTIAAN: Yeah, it is.\nWhat is even more cool in my opinion\nis that the cloud computing part, moving to buying compute",
    "It's kind of mind bending. It's phenomenal.\nCHRISTIAAN: Yeah, it is.\nWhat is even more cool in my opinion\nis that the cloud computing part, moving to buying compute\nversus, yeah... PAVAN: The device pattern changes.\nCHRISTIAAN: Exactly.\nThe subscription parts where you pay for your\non-demand kind of compute part, with GPU as an example.\nIt's just amazing.\nAnd that's what the future is in my opinion, too.\nPAVAN: Agree.\nCHRISTIAAN: So, moving a little bit to the hardware part\nof Windows environment and Windows in the Cloud and such,\nover the last 20 years, CPU, RAM,\nall those kind of way of doing the silicon\nand the motherboards and all those things coming together\nat an SOC haven't been changed that much.\nAnd now with NPU and other things coming along",
    "But first I'll go.\nSo, Windows 365, AVD are going skyrocket\nwith customer adoption, and in the companies,\nlike, very strong feeling of how to move to the cloud\nis happening with Windows, as well.\nSo, let me go first.\nTwo features that I'm very excited about is Windows 365 Boot\nto boot straight into a Cloud PC\nfrom the Windows 11 logon screen,\nas well as Azure Virtual Desktop,\nthe new autoscaling feature.\nSo, now I want to ask you,\nwhat's your favorite set of features?\n[Pavan laughing]\nPAVAN: That's a bit of a tricky one.\nI feel like, first, it's been an amazing learning journey\nwith you, and I appreciate internal to our teams,\nI get to be on self first and learn and try\nand look at all the new features\nyou guys have in the pipeline.\nFirst, I agree with you on both",
    "all those kind of way of doing the silicon\nand the motherboards and all those things coming together\nat an SOC haven't been changed that much.\nAnd now with NPU and other things coming along\nand innovation there, can you shed some light how\nthat will change the future of Windows streaming\nand Windows Cloud and AI?\nPAVAN: Yeah. I think that's a great question, Christiaan.\nI think you're right.\nIn the last couple years, with the advent of AI\nand AI spanning both the cloud and the client,\none of the places of innovation we're seeing\nin the Windows silicon platform\nand ecosystem space is the rise of neural engines.\nAnd I think neural engines give us the ability\nto run AI models--inference, specifically--\nat a level of power and performance that you don't have"
