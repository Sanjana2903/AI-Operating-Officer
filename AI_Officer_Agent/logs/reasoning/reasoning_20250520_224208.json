You can\nedit it. And that\u2019s really what is fundamentally a new way of building software. And we are\nlooking forward to making it much more broadly available in the coming months.\nAnd today, we are taking one more big leap forward. We are bridging the broader developer\ntools and services ecosystem with Copilot for the first time.
