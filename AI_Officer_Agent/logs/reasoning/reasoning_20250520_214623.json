    "Super excited to see something that I'm learning\nto appreciate and starting to use more often, as well.\nCHRISTIAAN: Yeah, it's great to see how the vision really\ncomes to life with blending Windows from the logon screen\ninto the Cloud PC\nas well as cross-platform, as you said with the Windows app.\nIt's great to see and hear your favorite feature, as well.\nPAVAN: Yeah. Actually, the GPU SKUs are another fantastic\nthing. A relatively thin and light machine,\nyou are backed by GPU SKUs in the cloud.\nYou can start running Blender and these workloads that\notherwise a PC in that class would not be able to do.\nIt's kind of mind bending. It's phenomenal.\nCHRISTIAAN: Yeah, it is.\nWhat is even more cool in my opinion\nis that the cloud computing part, moving to buying compute",
    "It's kind of mind bending. It's phenomenal.\nCHRISTIAAN: Yeah, it is.\nWhat is even more cool in my opinion\nis that the cloud computing part, moving to buying compute\nversus, yeah... PAVAN: The device pattern changes.\nCHRISTIAAN: Exactly.\nThe subscription parts where you pay for your\non-demand kind of compute part, with GPU as an example.\nIt's just amazing.\nAnd that's what the future is in my opinion, too.\nPAVAN: Agree.\nCHRISTIAAN: So, moving a little bit to the hardware part\nof Windows environment and Windows in the Cloud and such,\nover the last 20 years, CPU, RAM,\nall those kind of way of doing the silicon\nand the motherboards and all those things coming together\nat an SOC haven't been changed that much.\nAnd now with NPU and other things coming along",
    "But first I'll go.\nSo, Windows 365, AVD are going skyrocket\nwith customer adoption, and in the companies,\nlike, very strong feeling of how to move to the cloud\nis happening with Windows, as well.\nSo, let me go first.\nTwo features that I'm very excited about is Windows 365 Boot\nto boot straight into a Cloud PC\nfrom the Windows 11 logon screen,\nas well as Azure Virtual Desktop,\nthe new autoscaling feature.\nSo, now I want to ask you,\nwhat's your favorite set of features?\n[Pavan laughing]\nPAVAN: That's a bit of a tricky one.\nI feel like, first, it's been an amazing learning journey\nwith you, and I appreciate internal to our teams,\nI get to be on self first and learn and try\nand look at all the new features\nyou guys have in the pipeline.\nFirst, I agree with you on both",
    "handwritten docs. You can OCR them, put them into this Copilot. Engineers can ask it\nanything from how to make a car run faster or something super specific about some\nemissions output. And so, these are all the examples.\nIn fact, right after my keynote, you\u2019re going to hear from Lance from Blackrock in\nconversation with Judson on what they\u2019re doing with Aladdin and Azure. It\u2019s really an\nexciting work that they\u2019re doing, so it\u2019ll be great to listen to Lance. These are some\nexamples on how the stack is being used today, and we\u2019re just getting started. Adding, in\nfact, capabilities across every layer of the tech stack here, starting right at the\ninfrastructure layer. We continue to build out Azure as the world\u2019s computer. Over the"
