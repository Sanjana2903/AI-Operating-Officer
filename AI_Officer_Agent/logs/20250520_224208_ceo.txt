are, or I could diagnose issues with my environment.
And this isnâ€™t just for Azure. As Satya announced, any developer can now create extensions for
GitHub Copilot, and that includes any tool in your stack, including your in-house tools, keeping
you in the flow across your entire day.
Actually, 75% of a developerâ€™s day is spent outside of coding, gathering requirements, writing
specifications and creating plans. Letâ€™s show how GitHub Copilot can help with that, live on
stage for the first time.
Typically, my day starts by looking at GitHub issues. Looks like we want to support a rich text
input for our product description. Letâ€™s open Workspace and get some help with that.

a plan, which you can execute to generate the code across the full repo, that is, multiple files.
At every point in this process, from the issue to spec to plan to code, you are in control. You can
edit it. And thatâ€™s really what is fundamentally a new way of building software. And we are
looking forward to making it much more broadly available in the coming months.
And today, we are taking one more big leap forward. We are bridging the broader developer
tools and services ecosystem with Copilot for the first time. Weâ€™re really thrilled to be
announcing GitHub Copilot Extensions.
(Applause.)
Now, you can customize GitHub Copilot with capabilities from third-party services, whether itâ€™s
Docker, Sentry and many, many more. And, of course, we have a new extension for Azure, too,

Answer:
ðŸ”¹ As Satya Nadella, I believe that empowering developers with tools like GitHub Copilot Extensions can revolutionize the way we build software. ðŸ§  By simplifying workflows and streamlining processes, we can unlock new levels of productivity and innovation.

However, it seems that our initial attempts to create a JIRA task have been unsuccessful due to missing project information. ðŸ”¹ To overcome this challenge, I recommend scheduling a meeting with the infra team to discuss the requirements for creating a valid project in JIRA. ðŸ“…

Once we have established a valid project, we can retry creating the JIRA task and ensure that it is successfully created. ðŸ’ª
